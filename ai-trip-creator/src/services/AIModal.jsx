You can customize it based on your interests and preferences.\n* **Time Travel:**  This is estimated travel time, not including time spent at the destination. You may need to add additional time for transportation, waiting in lines, etc.\n* **Food:** I\'ve included suggestions for meals, but you can find many affordable dining options in Las Vegas.\n* **Transportation:**  Las Vegas has a public transportation system (RTC), but renting a car can be convenient for exploring areas outside the Strip.\n\n**Tips for a Cheap Budget:**\n\n* **Travel during the off-season:** Prices for flights, hotels, and activities are typically lower outside of peak season.\n* **Stay off the Strip:** Hotels and restaurants are generally more affordable off the Strip.\n* **Take advantage of free attractions:** There are many free things to see and do in Las Vegas, such as the fountains at Bellagio, the Neon Museum, and the Fremont Street Experience.\n* **Eat at buffets:**  Buffets are a great way to get a variety of food for a reasonable price.\n* **Drink water:**  Stay hydrated with tap water to avoid expensive bottled water.\n* **Look for deals and discounts:** Many attractions offer discounts for advance bookings or online purchases.\n* **Avoid casinos:**  While casinos are a big part of Las Vegas, they can be expensive. Limit your gambling budget and stick to free games or low-stakes tables.\n',
